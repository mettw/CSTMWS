# CSTMWS

A port of CST MicrowaveStudio to Matlab OOP.  This is very incomplete,
but it is simple to extend using the CST documentation under "VBScript"
and the example file 'runcst.mlx'.

The file 'runcst.mlx' contains an example LiveScript that uses
the CSTMWS class.  It also contains the text of the CST documentation
"Application Note â€“ Calling CST Studio from Matlab".  Note that you
won't be able to run this file since it loads a pre-existing CST MWS
file that is not included in this repository - This is just an example
to get you started.

This is *not* a general purpose port of CST's VBScript but is only
intended for running studies on an existing CST MWS file.

Please submit any extensions you make of this package for the
benefit of all users.
